This is a test runner for NUnitLite (http://nunitlite.org), that
redirects test results to Unity (http://unity3d.com) console.

After compilation of C# files Unity gives you two assemblies:

- Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll for 'Plugins' and '[Pro] Standard Assets'
- Assembly-CSharp.dll for other scripts

(Note, that Unity uses criptic names like '9cda786f9571f9a4d863974e5a5a9142')

Then, if you want to have tests in both places - you should call
UnityTestRunner.RunTests() from both places. One call per assembly
is enough, but you can call it as many times as you want - all
calls after first are ignored.

All of the above is correct for Js scripts too.

You can use 'MonoBahavior' classes for tests, but Unity gives you one
harmless warning per class. Using special Test classes would be a
better idea.
